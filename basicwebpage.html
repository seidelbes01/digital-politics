    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      “Contemporary analyses of international relations and the digital information revolution are in tentative embrace. On the one hand, the connections between new information technologies and politics generally are thought to be obvious. Some think the information revolution promises harmony, freedom and prosperity; others see totalitarianism, a permanent underclass, the debasement of the individual and citizen, and an end to art and reason.” (Herrera 93)

    <h3>More Introductory Quotes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“...international relations has evoked technology and technological change for decades without trying to embed it in a theoretical context.” (Herrera 94)</li>
      <li>“...the specific nature of the effects of new information technologies are indeterminate because the technology and the politics are inextricably intertwined. The political effects of the new technologies cannot yet be divined because the technology itself is not yet 'complete', but more importantly because its completion is a political, not just a technical process.” (Herrera 95)</li>
      <li>“..the effects of a mature digital information infrastructure are best conceptualized as the outcome of a three way political struggle between centralized political authorities (states), centralized economic entities (firms) and individuals.” (Herrera 95)</li>
      <li>“...despite the indeterminacy of technological change, we can present a matrix of choice, or possible outcomes.” (Herrera 95)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>“The international political implications of a digital information network come to rest, finally, on security…in its most basic sense: the security of individuals from physical violence, whether as war or crime, and security from despotism, public or private, internal or external.” (Herrera 122)</p>
    <p><b>Despotism:</b> the exercise of absolute power, especially in a cruel and oppressive way.</p>

    <p>“It has been thoughtlessly said ... that cryptography brings the 
      unprecedented promise of absolute privacy. ... In fact, it only 
      goes a short way to make up for the loss of an assurance
      against privacy that can never be regained” - Whitfield Diffie
      </p>
    
    <h2>Social Media and Politics</h2>
    <p>“As political communications scholar Francesco Bailo argues, the internet ‘revolutionises’ exposure to politics, not only by facilitating access to political information and communication, but by ‘bringing political contents through algorithmically determined filtering and recommendation systems to users who are not directly searching for them … The practice of politics on social media is characterised by its immediacy, the expectation that participants are able to see the effects of their actions, and it is driven by an adherence to specific interests or causes rather than movements or ideologies.” (Gauja 960)</p>
  
    <h2>Regulation of Digital Politics</h2>
    <p>“While the nature of political participation, organisation and advocacy has changed profoundly, the laws that regulate these political activities have not.” (Gauja 961)</p>
    <p>“To evolve with political practice and maintain its relevance, the law must also recognise contemporary practices of political participation and organisation, which in the modern era are becoming more and more separated from the formal institutions of representative democracy and increasingly mediated by big technology.” (Gauja 962)</p>
  
    <h2>Digital Politics in China</h2>
    <p>“At home and abroad, data serves as the lifeblood of China’s digital transformation.” (Liu 48)</p>
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Cyber Sovereignty:</b> ”[Some say] states should have control over the digital technologies, content, and infrastructures within their jurisdictions” (Liu 52)</li>
      <li><b>Data Politics:</b> “once citizens exchange their personal data for free services from digital firms, they usually lose control over future use of the data.” (Liu 56)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>“As digital technologies transform how individuals work, trade, and live, they have also begun to influence how states interact. At the core of this change is the proliferation of data as a strategic asset.” (Liu 64)</p>
  
    <h2>Globalization in Entertainment Within the EU</h2>
    <p>“Changes in law or technology that facilitate cross-national cultural trade have traditionally drawn the concern of observers worried about the cultural heritage—and products—of small markets.” (Waldfogel 419)</p>
    <p>“...even if a similar service is provided in several EU Member States, consumers typically only have access to the catalog offered in their own country of residence.” (Waldfogel 420)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Globalization is limited by copyright law and distribution rights.</li>
      <li>The United States is the clearly favored country of origin for entertainment services.</li>
    </ul>
