    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      “Contemporary analyses of international relations and the digital information revolution are in tentative embrace. On the one hand, the connections between new information technologies and politics generally are thought to be obvious. Some think the information revolution promises harmony, freedom and prosperity; others see totalitarianism, a permanent underclass, the debasement of the individual and citizen, and an end to art and reason.” (Herrera 93)

    <h3>More Introductory Quotes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“...international relations has evoked technology and technological change for decades without trying to embed it in a theoretical context.” (Herrera 94)</li>
      <li>“...the specific nature of the effects of new information technologies are indeterminate because the technology and the politics are inextricably intertwined. The political effects of the new technologies cannot yet be divined because the technology itself is not yet 'complete', but more importantly because its completion is a political, not just a technical process.” (Herrera 95)</li>
      <li>“..the effects of a mature digital information infrastructure are best conceptualized as the outcome of a three way political struggle between centralized political authorities (states), centralized economic entities (firms) and individuals.” (Herrera 95)</li>
      <li>“...despite the indeterminacy of technological change, we can present a matrix of choice, or possible outcomes.” (Herrera 95)</li>
